# HackTues365 Project
Defuse the bomb.

## Game Rules And Tutorial

Work with a partner to defuse the bomb.
One of the two players should only look at the instructions while the other one is defusing the bomb.
Adhere to the time limit otherwise the bomb explodes.

Have fun!

## How do I play?

Connect your **Arduino** board the PC and then start the Generator app.
Click **Generate** and wait for the instructions to upload.
You can then disconnect the board and start playing the game.

## Used Technologies

All of the game logic relies on the **Arduino** to run on.
The random values for each game are generated by a **.NET Windows Forms Application**.
Both processes are connected via a serial connection based on the **System.IO.Ports** library included in **.NET**.

## Dependecies
